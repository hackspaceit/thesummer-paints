		<h3 id="server"><strong>A) Server Requirements</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
<p>Please make sure that the following server requirements are met as listed:</p>
		<ul><li>PHP version 5.5 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.</li>

<li>URL rewrite enabled (usually enabled by default on most servers)</li>
<li>MySQL 5.1.0 or above</li>
<li>allow_url_fopen must be enabled in php.ini (if not enabled)</li>
</ul> 

		<hr>

		<h3 id="installation"><strong>B) Installation Guide</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Please make sure that you meet the server requirements before starting installation.</p> 

		<p>After purchasing CryptoNet PHP Script from Codecanyon, Download the complete zip package of our PHP script & extract it. It contains documentation folder and CryptoNet.zip files.</p>  
		
		<img src="assets/images/cryptonet-server-upload.jpg" width="75%"/>
		<br/><br/>
		<p>STEP 1: Upload the <b>CryptoNet.zip</b> folder to your server and uncompress/extract all the files to the root directory of your domain name on your web server. Normally the index.php file will be at your root. You can upload the package on your web server in two ways via FTP or File manager.</p> 

		<img src="assets/images/cryptonet-files.jpg" width="75%"/>
		<br/><br/>
		
		<p>STEP 2:  Create a MySQL database and database user on your server who has all the permissions to access and modify database.</p>
If you do not know, how to create a database then ask for help to your hosting provider or search help topics on your hosting or search on any search engine for How to create a MYSQL database. You will found so many step by step guides and video tutorials.
<br/><br/>
<p>STEP 3: Run the auto installer script by accessing the URL <b>https://www.your-domain-name.com/install/</b> (If you have uploaded the files in the root directory of your domain) or <b>https://www.your-domain-name.com/subdirectory/install/</b> (If you have uploaded the files in the subdirectory of your domain) in a web browser.</p>
Note: If you want to install the Corona Net PHP Script on Non-SSL Version of your domain name then firstly open .htaccess file in the root directory of your server and comment out the code in line 155 and 156 which is as follows:
<br/><br/>
Before Comment Out:
<br/><br/>
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off<br/>
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]
<br/><br/>
After Comment Out:
<br/><br/>
#RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off<br/>
#RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]
<br/><br/>
After that, please use http instead of https in STEP 3.<br/><br/>
<p>STEP 4: Enter the database details which you have created on your server in the STEP 2 and click <b>“Install”</b> button.</p>

<img src="assets/images/cryptonet-db.jpg" width="50%"/>

<p>STEP 5: On the next screen, Enter email and password to access admin area. Now, again Click <b>“Install”</b> button.</p>
